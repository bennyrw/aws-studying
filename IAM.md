# Best practices

Protect root account and lock access away
Use named admins instead (these can be revoked/disabled)

Some tasks still need root user - e.g. closing an account, payments/billing, transferring stuff to other accounts (e.g. S3 domain), requesting removal of some throttles (e.g. port 25 email), create CloudFront key pairs

Least privilege
